# Onsite Interview Preparation Template

A concise, reusable plan for software engineering/data roles covering coding, system design, and behavioral interviews. Copy this file per company and tailor the placeholders.

---

## Overview
- Role:
- Company/Team:
- Interview Date(s):
- Interview Blocks/Types (e.g., 2x Coding, 1x Design, 1x Behavioral):
- Target Signals (problem solving, code quality, testing, communication, leadership):

## 4-Week Timeline
- Week 4 – Baseline & Cadence
  - Diagnostic rounds; identify gaps; set daily schedule and topics.
  - Build flashcard deck for patterns, complexity, and design concepts.
- Week 3 – Depth & Weaknesses
  - Focused drills on weak topics; daily design practice; start STAR bank.
- Week 2 – Realistic Mocks
  - Full-length mocks; company/product research; refine answers.
- Week 1 – Polish & Logistics
  - Light practice; rest; dry runs; confidence reps; finalize logistics.

## Daily Practice Block (2–4 hours)
- 15m Warm‑up: 1 easy + quick pattern review.
- 60m Coding: 1–2 mediums from weak topics; re-drill past misses.
- 45m System Design: 1 scenario (15m read, 25m design, 5m critique).
- 30m Behavioral: 1–2 STAR stories; iterate phrasing; align to values.
- 15m Retrospective: log misses, flashcards, next focus.

## Coding Practice Plan
- Topics:
  - Arrays/Strings, Hashing, Two Pointers/Sliding Window, Binary Search
  - Sorting/Greedy, Stacks/Queues, Trees/Tries, Heap/Intervals
  - Graphs (BFS/DFS, shortest paths), Union-Find
  - Dynamic Programming (1D/2D/Knapsack), Math/Bit, Geometry (if needed)
- Weekly Targets:
  - 8–12 mediums; 2–3 hards if relevant; 30% re-drills of past misses.
- Problem Loop:
  1) Clarify constraints/examples → 2) Brute force → 3) Optimize via pattern → 4) Implement cleanly → 5) Test edge cases → 6) Complexity → 7) Post‑mortem.

## System Design Template (45–60 min)
- Clarify Requirements
  - Users, use cases, constraints, non‑goals.
- Constraints & Estimates
  - QPS, DAU/MAU, data size, latency/SLA, consistency needs.
- High‑Level Architecture
  - APIs, components, data flow; draw a boxes/arrows diagram.
- Data & Storage
  - Schema, indexing, sharding strategy, caches (client/edge/app/DB).
- Scale & Performance
  - Partitioning, replication, load balancing, async processing/messaging.
- Reliability & Operations
  - Idempotency, retries, backpressure, failover, DR/RPO/RTO, monitoring.
- Deep Dive (pick one area)
  - e.g., feed ranking, search, media pipeline, transactions.
- Trade‑offs & Evolution
  - CAP/consistency vs availability, cost, complexity; phased rollout, migrations.

### Quick Design One‑Pager (scratch)
- Requirements:
- Scale assumptions:
- APIs (read/write):
- Diagram (components + data flow):
- Storage model:
- Bottlenecks + mitigations:
- Trade‑offs + why:
- Metrics + rollout plan:

## Behavioral (STAR) Bank
Create 6–10 stories that cover distinct themes (conflict, leadership, failure, ownership, ambiguity, impact, learning).

### STAR Template (duplicate per story)
- Title/Theme:
- Situation: (brief context)
- Task: (your objective)
- Action: (steps you took; alternatives considered; reasoning)
- Result: (measurable outcomes; what changed)
- Reflection: (lessons; what you’d do differently)
- Values Alignment: (which company values it demonstrates)

## Company Research
- Role/Job Description: required signals, core responsibilities.
- Product/Team: 2–3 recent launches; metrics that matter.
- Interviewers (if known): backgrounds; likely focus areas.
- Values: select stories that map cleanly.
- “Why this company/team”: 3 concise, specific points.
- Questions to Ask: impact, roadmap, collaboration, ownership, on‑call, growth.

## Logistics & Day‑Of
- Scheduling: agenda confirmed, time zones, breaks, links/access.
- Setup: editor/IDE, whiteboard/paper, markers, quiet room, video/audio checks.
- Tools Rules: language, references, external libs policy.
- In‑Person: route, arrival buffer, ID, dress (smart casual), water/snack.
- Day‑Of Flow: clarify; think aloud; small examples; check edge cases; test; summarize.

## Mock Interview Plan
- Cadence: Week 3–2 → 2 coding + 1 design + 1 behavioral per week. Week 1 → taper to 1–2 total.
- Sources: peers, platforms, mentors; rotate interviewers to vary styles.
- Feedback: time usage, misses, communication notes, next focus.

## Tracking Sheet (copy per day)
- Date:
- Focus Area:
- Problems/Scenarios practiced:
- Signals Practiced (problem solving, code quality, tests, comms):
- Misses/Gaps:
- Flashcards/Drills to add:
- Next Actions (tomorrow):

## Checklists
### Day‑Before
- [ ] Review STAR bank; 3 strongest stories front‑of‑mind.
- [ ] Rehearse 1 high‑level design; no cramming new topics.
- [ ] Prepare: laptop/charger, notepad/marker, water, route plan.
- [ ] Sleep target: 7–8 hours.

### Day‑Of
- [ ] Confirm schedule/logins/access.
- [ ] Quiet space set; audio/video tested.
- [ ] Scratch area ready; on‑screen timer if virtual.
- [ ] Breathe; warm‑up 1 easy problem or design outline.

## Post‑Interview
- Send thank‑you notes within 24 hours with 1–2 specific callbacks.
- Write a retro: what went well, what to improve, next steps.

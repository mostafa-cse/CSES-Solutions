# 📘 CSES Problem Set – Introductory Problems

This repository contains solutions to the **Introductory Problems** section of the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). Each problem is organized into its own folder, which may contain multiple implementations or approaches in different languages or techniques.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
cses-intro/
├── Weird Algorithm/
│   ├── Iterative solution.cpp
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
├── Missing Number/
│   ├── brute_force.cpp
│   ├── optimized.py
│   └── README.md
├── Increasing Array/
│   └── increasing_array.cpp
└── ...
```

* **Each folder** is named after the problem title.
* **Each folder** may contain:

  * Multiple solution files (e.g., `solution.cpp`, `solution.py`, etc.)
  * A `README.md` file (optional) explaining the logic or comparing methods.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cses-intro.git
   cd cses-intro
   ```

2. Navigate to a problem folder:

   ```bash
   cd "Weird Algorithm"
   ```

3. Run a solution (example for C++):

   ```bash
   g++ solution.cpp -o solution
   ./solution
   ```

## 💡 Why Multiple Solutions?

Some problems include:

* A brute-force and an optimized version
* Solutions in different languages (e.g., C++, Python, Java)
* Commentary or time/space complexity comparisons

This format is helpful for learning, comparing approaches, and revisiting improved strategies.

## 🛠️ Language and Style

* 🧠 Clean, readable code with comments
* ⏱️ Time-efficient logic wherever possible
* 💬 Multiple programming languages supported (C++, Python, etc.)
